# Embedded Linux Labs

This repository contains lab exercises and materials from my **Embedded Linux course**.  
It was originally hosted on GitLab and has been mirrored here to my personal GitHub for reference, documentation, and portfolio organization.

## 📘 Overview

The course focuses on **developing, building, and debugging software for embedded Linux environments**, primarily using the Raspberry Pi and a cross-compilation toolchain.  
Through these labs, I learned to combine software engineering and hardware interaction in a Linux-based embedded system.
