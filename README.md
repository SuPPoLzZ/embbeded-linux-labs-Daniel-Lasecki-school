## Student instructions

1. Install course VM (you need to have VirtualBox installed).
2. <b>Fork</b> this repository so that you have your own exact replica with write permissions.
3. <b>Clone</b> repository contents into course VM. The VM has cross-compilation tools set up, and vscode as well. 
4. Work through the lab assignments. Each lab requires code modifications and produces other deliverables like oscilloscope data, and you will need to <b>commit</b> all that to your repository.
5. Sometimes lab assignments are updated here. You might need to <b>pull</b> updates to your working directory, merge updates with your existing work, and <b>push</b> to your own repository!
